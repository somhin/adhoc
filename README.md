# Suggestions for pull request description :sunglasses:	

- Copilot has introduced a feature that assists developers in writing effective pull request descriptions.
- Different teams have different rules and expectations regarding the information included in pull request descriptions.
To accommodate diverse needs, Copilot allows developers to insert marker tags in their pull request descriptions.
- Once the pull request description is saved, Copilot, with the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model, automatically expands the markers, providing comprehensive and detailed descriptions of the changes made in the pull request.
- Developers can review and modify the suggested description provided by Copilot.

## Markers
* `copilot:all` showcases all the different kinds of content in one go.
* `copilot:summary` expands to a one-paragraph summary of the changes in the pull request.
* `copilot:walkthrough` expands to a detailed list of changes, including links to the relevant pieces of code.
* `copilot:poem expands` to a poem about the changes in the pull request.

## Gentest
Use AI to identify changes in your PR that may be lacking tests, and suggests tests for you to build on or use directly.

## Ghost Text
Copilot users have come to expect "ghost text" (the subdued, inline suggestions that appear as you type in the editor), Users can expect real-time suggestions for their pull request descriptions as they type.

# **Ongoing Explorations and Experiments**
## Resolving issues with AI
> Someone just filed an issue on your repository: "Replace TensorFlow with PyTorch". Seems like a big job? Maybe you are not sure where to start? We think that AI can help.

> Resolving issue with AI is a prototyping functionality to automatically describe how to solve an issue and even to automatically suggest the changes you need to make. In this video we file the issue about moving to PyTorch and use our AI to example how it might be done, to generate code suggestions and raise a new pull request.

## Reviewing pull-requests with AI
- Code review and preparing pull requests (PRs) for review consume a significant amount of developer time. :dizzy_face:	
- Reviewving pull-requests AI-powered solution aims to assist in this process and reduce time spent.
- The AI accurately describes the changes in a pull request and performs code review.
- Actionable suggestions for improvement are provided by the AI, which can be easily accepted with a click.
- While human reviewers won't be replaced, the AI helps streamline the review cycle.

### Many more upcoming AI tools!
- `AI-powered PR completion` AI bot with the capability to complete pull requests given a few indicative edits. Add comments, complete function, guide developer how to adjust their code.
- `AI-powered PR repair` PR process can damage your flow. There is inevitably a delay while you wait for a review, or you wait for Actions to run. And many PRs go back and forth a few times. Each time you switch in and then switch out again is disruptive. We want to know if we can use artificial intelligence to fill in the gaps and reduce the number of switches.
